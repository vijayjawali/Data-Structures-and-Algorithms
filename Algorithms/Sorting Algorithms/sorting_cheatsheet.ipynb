    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bubble Sort**: \n",
    "   - Simple but inefficient for large lists\n",
    "   - Adaptive: becomes faster for nearly sorted arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selection Sort**: \n",
    "   - Simple implementation\n",
    "   - Performs well on small lists\n",
    "   - Makes the minimum number of swaps (n-1 in the worst case)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insertion Sort**: \n",
    "   - Efficient for small data sets\n",
    "   - Adaptive: efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merge Sort**: \n",
    "   - Divide and conquer algorithm\n",
    "   - Consistent performance: O(n log n) for all cases\n",
    "   - Not in-place: requires additional memory\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quick Sort**: \n",
    "   - Usually the fastest in practice for random data\n",
    "   - Divide and conquer algorithm\n",
    "   - Performance depends on the choice of pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Heap Sort**: \n",
    "   - In-place sorting algorithm\n",
    "   - Consistent performance: O(n log n) for all cases\n",
    "   - Not stable, but this can be addressed with some modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Counting Sort**: \n",
    "   - Efficient when range of input data (k) is not significantly larger than the number of elements (n)\n",
    "   - Not a comparison-based algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Radix Sort**: \n",
    "   - Works well for integers or strings with fixed-size keys\n",
    "   - Can be faster than O(n log n) algorithms for suitable data\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Bucket Sort**: \n",
    "   - Works well when input is uniformly distributed over a range\n",
    "   - Often used with floating-point values\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Tree Sort**:\n",
    "    - Uses a binary search tree (BST) data structure\n",
    "    - Simple implementation if a BST is already available\n",
    "    - Useful when data is streamed or comes in chunks, as it allows for efficient insertion of new elements\n",
    "    - Worst-case occurs when the BST becomes skewed (effectively a linked list)\n",
    "    - Can be made more efficient by using a self-balancing BST (like an AVL tree or Red-Black tree)"
