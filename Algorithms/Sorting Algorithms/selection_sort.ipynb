    "## Selection Sort Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.\n",
    "3. Swap it with the first unsorted element.\n",
    "4. Move the boundary of the sorted part one element to the right.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the entire list is sorted.\n",
