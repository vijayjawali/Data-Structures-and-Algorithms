    "# Tree Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tree** is a hierarchical, non-linear data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Unlike linear data structures such as arrays or linked lists, trees represent hierarchical relationships between elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Terminology and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node\n",
    "A fundamental unit of a tree that contains data and references to other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [DATA]\n",
    "   /  |  \\\n",
    "  /   |   \\\n",
    " v    v    v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root\n",
    "The topmost node of a tree, serving as the starting point for traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      Root\n",
    "       ↓\n",
    "     [A]\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "  [B]   [C]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge\n",
    "A connection between two nodes, representing the relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     [A]\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "   /     \\\n",
    " [B]     [C]\n",
    "   ↑       ↑\n",
    "   Edge    Edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent and Child\n",
    "A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root is called a child, while the node it's connected to is called a parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    [Parent]\n",
    "    /      \\\n",
    " [Child]  [Child]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leaf\n",
    "A node with no children.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     [A]\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "  [B]   [C]\n",
    " /  \\\n",
    "[D] [E] ← Leaf nodes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth of a Node\n",
    "The length of the path from the root to the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A] ← Depth 0\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Depth 1\n",
    " /\n",
    "[D] ← Depth 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height of a Node\n",
    "The length of the longest path from the node to a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A] ← Height 2\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Height 1\n",
    " /\n",
    "[D] ← Height 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height of a Tree\n",
    "The height of its root node, or the depth of its deepest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A]\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Tree height: 2\n",
    " /\n",
    "[D]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Size\n",
    "The total number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A]\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Size: 4 nodes\n",
    " /\n",
    "[D]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtree\n",
    "A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A]\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Subtree rooted at [C]\n",
    " / \\\n",
    "[D] [E] ← Subtree rooted at [B]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree\n",
    "The number of children a node has.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   [A] ← Degree 2\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    " [B] [C] ← Degree 0\n",
    " / \\\n",
    "[D] [E] ← Degree 0\n",
    "```\n",
