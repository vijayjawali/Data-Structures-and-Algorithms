    "# Threaded Binary Tree Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Threaded Binary Trees are designed to make tree traversal more efficient by eliminating the need for auxiliary data structures (like stacks or queues) during in-order, preorder, or postorder traversals. Below is a detailed explanation, along with diagrams to illustrate the concepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Issues with Regular Binary Tree Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standard binary tree, each node typically contains two pointers:  \n",
    "• Left pointer  \n",
    "• Right pointer  \n",
    "\n",
    "A normal in-order traversal may use a recursion stack or an explicit stack/queue. This leads to extra memory usage and overhead. Without additional links, once you move away from a node, it becomes non-trivial to backtrack without external help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Regular Binary Tree (Diagram)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    A\n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "      B   C\n",
    "     / \\   \\\n",
    "    D   E   F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a typical scenario, to visit D -> B -> E -> A -> C -> F in in-order, we either rely on recursion or push/pop operations on a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Threaded Binary Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Threaded Binary Tree uses some of the NULL pointers to store additional information: **“threads.”** These threads link a node to its in-order predecessor or successor. By using these links, we can traverse the tree without relying on an external stack or recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a node’s `right` pointer. Sometimes it may be `NULL` if the node does not have a right child. In a right-threaded tree, instead of leaving it `NULL`, we can make it point to the node’s in-order successor. Similarly, a left-threaded tree can have the `left` pointer store the in-order predecessor if that pointer would otherwise be `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a conceptual diagram (not an actual binary tree but a structural depiction of threads):\n",

    "Thread   Thread\n",

    "Left thread points to in-order predecessor (if left child is NULL)\n",
    "Right thread points to in-order successor (if right child is NULL)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Threaded Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Threaded**  \n",
    "   • Nodes are threaded either on the left or the right side.  \n",
    "   – *Left Threaded:* if a node has no left child, then its left pointer points to its in-order predecessor.  \n",
    "   – *Right Threaded:* if a node has no right child, then its right pointer points to its in-order successor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Double Threaded**  \n",
    "   • Each node may have threads in both directions.  \n",
    "   – If the left child doesn’t exist, the left pointer can store the in-order predecessor.  \n",
    "   – If the right child doesn’t exist, the right pointer can store the in-order successor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack-less (or Queue-less) Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "With threads linking each node to its successor or predecessor, one can move through the tree iteratively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-order Threaded Traversal**  \n",
    "   – Begin with the leftmost node.  \n",
    "   – Follow right threads to move to the successor.  \n",
    "   – Avoid recursion or an external stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preorder or Postorder**  \n",
    "   – Variants exist where a node’s pointers guide you through the tree.  \n",
    "   – Each approach modifies which links (left or right) are maintained as threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Threaded Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "• Elimination of recursion overhead or an external stack/queue.  \n",
    "• In-order traversal becomes a simple linear pass using right threads (or left threads for reverse order).  \n",
    "• More efficient use of memory since NULL pointers are replaced by meaningful thread links.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "By incorporating threads, binary tree traversal can be performed smoothly in an iterative manner without additional data structures."

    "## Binary Tree vs Threaded Binary Tree: Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointer Utilization\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Contains many NULL pointers (wasted space) - approximately n+1 NULL pointers in a tree with n nodes.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Utilizes otherwise NULL pointers to store threads that link to predecessor or successor nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Efficiency\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Less memory-efficient due to unused NULL pointers.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: More memory-efficient as it repurposes NULL pointers for threading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Each node has data and pointers to left and right children, which may be NULL.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Each node has additional boolean flags (lthread and rthread) that indicate whether pointers are normal child pointers or threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversal Mechanism\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Requires recursion or an explicit stack for traversal.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Can be traversed without recursion or stack by following threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversal Efficiency\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: O(n) time complexity with O(h) space complexity for traversal (h = height of tree).\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity for traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking Ability\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Difficult to move from a node to its parent without explicitly storing parent pointers.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Easy to find in-order predecessors and successors through threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Complexity\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Simpler to implement and understand.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: More complex implementation due to thread management during insertions and deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successor/Predecessor Access\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Finding in-order successor/predecessor requires O(h) time.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: In-order successor/predecessor can be found in O(1) time if thread pointers are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Modification\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Insertion and deletion are relatively straightforward.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Insertion and deletion require careful handling of thread pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: General purpose use where traversal performance isn't critical.\n",
    "- **Threaded Binary Tree**: Applications requiring frequent traversals, especially when memory is limited or efficient non-recursive traversal is needed.\n",

    "## In-Order Traversal in Threaded Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inorder_traversal` method performs an in-order traversal of a threaded binary tree without using recursion or an additional stack. This is one of the key advantages of threaded binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "    - Create an empty list `result` to store the visited node values\n",
    "    - Start from the leftmost node of the tree by calling `self.leftmost(self.root)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Traversal Loop**:\n",
    "    - Continue traversing until we reach the dummy node (which signals the end of traversal)\n",
    "    - For each node visited:\n",
    "      - Add the current node's data to the result list\n",
    "      - Determine how to find the next node (in-order successor)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding the Successor**:\n",
    "    - If the current node's right pointer is a thread (`current.rthread` is True):\n",
    "      - The right pointer already points directly to the in-order successor\n",
    "      - Simply follow this thread: `current = current.right`\n",
    "    - If the current node's right pointer is a normal child pointer:\n",
    "      - The in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree\n",
    "      - Find this node by calling `self.leftmost(current.right)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Result**:\n",
    "    - After traversing all nodes, return the list of values in in-order sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm demonstrates the efficiency of threaded binary trees for traversal:\n",
    "- No recursion stack is needed\n",
    "- No auxiliary data structures (like stacks or queues) are required\n",
    "- Space complexity is O(1) excluding the result list\n",
    "- Time complexity remains O(n) where n is the number of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "The threads provide direct paths to successor nodes, making the traversal straightforward and efficient compared to traditional binary tree traversal methods."
