    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Binary Tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This constraint creates a hierarchical structure that can be efficiently traversed and manipulated.\n",

    "    [Node]\n",
    "   /      \\\n",

    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each node can have at most two children\n",
    "- Each child node is labeled as either a \"left child\" or a \"right child\"\n",
    "- Left child precedes right child in order of traversal\n",
    "- The maximum number of nodes at level 'n' is 2ⁿ\n",
    "- The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is 2ʰ - 1\n",

    "## Basic Tree Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion**  \n",
    "    - Add a new node to the tree based on its ordering rules.  \n",
    "    - In binary trees, compare the new value with the current node and recursively insert into the left or right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion**  \n",
    "    - Remove a specified node while maintaining the tree structure.  \n",
    "    - In binary trees, different cases occur when the node has zero, one, or two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traversal**  \n",
    "    - Systematically visit all nodes to process or display them.  \n",
    "    - Common binary tree traversals:  \n",
    "      - In-order (left, root, right)  \n",
    "      - Pre-order (root, left, right)  \n",
    "      - Post-order (left, right, root)  \n",
    "      - Level-order (breadth-first)  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Searching**  \n",
    "    - Determine whether a target value exists in the tree.  \n",
    "    - In binary search trees, traverse left or right depending on comparisons until the value is found or a leaf is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Auxiliary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Height Calculation**  \n",
    "    - Measures the longest path from a node down to a leaf.  \n",
    "    - Useful in determining how “balanced” the tree is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting Nodes**  \n",
    "    - Totals the nodes in the entire tree or a subtree.  \n",
    "    - Recursively add counts of children and root.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finding Minimum/Maximum**  \n",
    "    - Follows left (or right) pointers in a binary search tree to find the smallest (or largest) node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Balance**  \n",
    "    - Verifies if a tree is balanced (height difference of subtrees ≤ 1).  \n",
    "    - Recursively compute heights and compare left vs. right subtrees."
