    "# Introduction to Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in separate objects called nodes. Each node contains two fields:\n",
    "- **Data**: Stores the actual value/information\n",
    "- **Reference/Pointer**: Points to the next node in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a linked list can be implemented using classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data=None):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Linked Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are valuable when:\n",
    "- You need dynamic memory allocation\n",
    "- You need frequent insertions and deletions\n",
    "- You don't need random access to elements\n",
    "- Memory efficiency is important and you want to avoid pre-allocating space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison: Linked Lists vs Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Linked List | Array |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| Access | O(n) - Linear | O(1) - Constant |\n",
    "| Insertion/Deletion (beginning) | O(1) - Constant | O(n) - Linear |\n",
    "| Insertion/Deletion (middle) | O(n) - Linear | O(n) - Linear |\n",
    "| Memory Allocation | Dynamic | Static (in most languages) |\n",
    "| Memory Usage | Higher (extra pointer storage) | Lower |\n",
    "| Implementation | More complex | Simpler |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays Over Linked Lists:\n",
    "- **Direct access**: Elements can be accessed by index in O(1) time\n",
    "- **Cache locality**: Better performance due to contiguous memory allocation\n",
    "- **Memory efficiency**: Less overhead per element (no pointers)\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Lists Over Arrays:\n",
    "- **Dynamic size**: No need to pre-allocate memory\n",
    "- **Efficient insertions/deletions**: Especially at the beginning\n",
    "- **No memory wastage**: Only allocates exactly what is needed\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Easy to grow, shrink, or reorganize\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both next and previous nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to the first node\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Circular Doubly Linked List**: Combines features of circular and doubly linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding linked lists is fundamental to grasping more complex data structures and algorithms. While they may seem more complex than arrays initially, their flexibility makes them indispensable in many programming scenarios."
