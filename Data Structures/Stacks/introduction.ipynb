    "# Stacks: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a linear data structure following the principle of **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**. This means the last element added (“pushed”) to the stack is the first element accessed (“popped”) when removing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack as an Abstract Data Type (ADT)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation**: Initialize an empty stack.  \n",
    "2. **Push**: Insert a new element at the top.  \n",
    "3. **Pop**: Remove the element from the top.  \n",
    "4. **Top/Peek**: Retrieve (but do not remove) the top element.  \n",
    "5. **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack contains no elements.\n",
    "6. **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagrammatic Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to visualize a stack is to imagine a pile of books:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    +------+\n",
    "    | Top  |  <-- Top of the stack\n",
    "    +------+\n",
    "    |      |\n",
    "    |      |\n",
    "    |      |\n",
    "    +------+\n",
    "    | Base |  <-- Bottom (first pushed, last popped)\n",
    "    +------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- New items are pushed onto the top.\n",
    "- Items are popped off from the same top.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Push, Pop, and Top Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Push(x)**: Places an item `x` on the top.  \n",
    "  - Check capacity (optional, depending on implementation).  \n",
    "  - Insert `x` as the new top element.\n",
    "- **Pop()**: Removes the current top element.  \n",
    "  - Return the removed element or error if empty.  \n",
    "- **Top()**: Returns the value at the top without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Call Management**: Storing return addresses, local variables, and states during nested function calls.  \n",
    "- **Undo/Redo Operations**: Text editors and drawing tools use a stack to revert or replay recent actions.  \n",
    "- **Expression Evaluation**: Converting and processing infix, postfix, or prefix notations in compilers.  \n",
    "- **Browser Navigation**: History tracking through back/forward stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stack Implementations Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Array**:\n",
    "    - Use a fixed-size array.\n",
    "    - Maintain a top pointer indicating the current end of the stack.\n",
    "    - When pushing, increment top and place the element.\n",
    "    - When popping, remove the element at top and decrement top.\n",
    "    - Limited by the initial fixed capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Array**:\n",
    "    - Similar to a simple array, but grows when capacity is reached.\n",
    "    - On push, if full, allocate a larger array and copy elements.\n",
    "    - Top pointer tracks the active end of the stack.\n",
    "    - Offers flexibility at the cost of occasional re-allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linked List**:\n",
    "    - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.\n",
    "    - Top of the stack is the head of the list.\n",
    "    - Push by adding a new node at the head.\n",
    "    - Pop by removing the head node and returning its data.\n",
    "    - Size grows or shrinks as needed, only limited by memory availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-structured stacks offer a clean and efficient way to handle scenarios where reversing or tracking the last input is required."
